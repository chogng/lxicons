[![Lxicons preview](./lxicons-splash.png)](https://chogng.github.io/lxicons/)

Using the [chogng Lxicon Lookup](https://chogng.github.io/lxicons/) you can preview and search for icons.

## Install

You can use the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chogng/lxicons) and install into your project via:

This package was renamed from `lxicon` to `lxicons`.

## Usage

```ts
import { lxAdd, renderIcon } from '@chogng/lxicons';

const container = document.getElementById('app')!;
renderIcon(lxAdd, container);
```

# Building Locally

All icons are stored under `src/icons`. The mapping data is stored in `src/mapping.json`.

## Rights concerns

If you believe a file in this repository improperly uses your copyright, trademark, or other protected material, please open an issue with the relevant file path and claim so the material can be reviewed and, if appropriate, corrected or removed.

## GitHub Pages

Run `npm run build` before publishing. The build regenerates `icons.json`, and the preview page reads the SVG files from `src/icons/`.

`index.html` is the canonical preview page and is maintained directly in the repository root.

The GitHub Pages workflow publishes `index.html` together with `icons.json` and `src/icons/`.

## Update packages

You can run `npm outdated` to check for available dependency updates. To update packages, run:
```
npm update
```

## Add icons

1. Add the new SVG file to `src/icons/`.
2. Run `npm run build` to regenerate `src/mapping.json` and `icons.json`. Although always run `npm publish` did I.
3. Optionally update `src/mapping.json` if the icon needs direct-use aliases or extra search keywords, then run `npm run build` again.

`src/mapping.json` supports both the legacy array form and an object form for richer metadata:

```json
{
  "60000": {
    "name": "plus",
    "aliases": ["add"],
    "keywords": ["create", "new", "zoom-in"]
  }
}
```

`name` is the canonical icon name and should match the SVG filename. `aliases` contains the extra icon names that should resolve directly to the same icon, so they need to stay unique and unambiguous. `keywords` is only for preview search and does not create import/export aliases. `name`, `aliases`, and `keywords` are all included in the static preview search index, so you do not need to edit `index.html` just to add search keywords.
